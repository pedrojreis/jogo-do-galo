# Jogo do Galo

This is a school project made back in 2009. The game is called _Jogo do Galo_ (Tic-Tac-Toe) and by no means it follows good practices as I was just learning C at the time.

This game is supposed to be played by 2 players locally.

Please take this project with a grain of salt

## Installation

This requires C & Makefile installed and configured on your IDE.

```bash
make -f Makefile
```

## Usage

After the installation it should generate a jogo_galo file and you should run like

```bash
sudo ./jogo_galo
```
